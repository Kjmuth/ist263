		<h1>Kyle Muth's Biography</h1>
		<h2>Personal Info</h2>
		<main>
		<p>Hello, I am Kyle Muth. I am an Information management and technology major with a focus on information security. I first got into InfoSec when I was a sophomore in high school and started to self-teach myself a bunch about many topics across IT. I have participated in everything from actual development to the design and administration of projects through my own company. Besides starting my own business, I am <strong>COMPTIA SEC+</strong> certified and am passionate about always learning more about my field. Outside of work I am on the club volleyball team, involved with Greek life, involved with NEXIS, and other programs as well. I love hanging out with friends and being able to spend time outdoors when I can. I also love to cook and watch tv shows in my free time. </p>
